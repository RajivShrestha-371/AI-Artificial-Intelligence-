Given a 4 - litre jug filled with water & an empty 3 - litre Jug, how can one obtain exactly 2 liters in 4 litres jug. There is no measuring mark on any of them.
•	Define WaterJug Class with a constructor to initialize the initial and goal state
•	Define boolean goalTest(current_state, goal_state) to check if current_state is goal_state or not
•	Define successor() with reference to the production rules to generate possible child(s).
•	Verify if successor() is working properly or not
•	Define DFS/BFS search algorithm to find the solution
•	Modify search algorithm to store state,parent in CLOSED list and also define generate_path() to provide the path of solution.)

Global heuristic: e(p) is calculated as
•	For each block that has the correct support structure, give +1 to every block in the support structure. 
•	For each block that has a wrong support structure: -1 to every block in the support structure
